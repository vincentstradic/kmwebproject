**Welcome, my friends, to the Fan Club of Kabirou Mbodje!**

In this website, I'm going to explore the business and private life of Kabirou, based on a huge array of confidential materials that he, himself, provided in the spirit of full disclosure. The First Rule of our Club: there is no such thing as privacy!

Every day I'll be publishing some new documents and letters by Kabirou, his business partners, employees and friends. We are going to explore various aspects of Wari ownership, management and performance, especially in the recent months. We'll review Wari cashflows (as well as CSI, Interlinq) to see, if those recent accusations against Kabirou have grounds (spoiler: yes, at least partially).

We'll spend a lot of time analysing the Tigo deal - how it started, what went wrong and what is Kabirou's current strategy on fighting Millicom/Consortium and recovering his losses. He is taking a very aggressive strategy (that's what we love him for), but his lawyers are a bit less than optimistic. I'll share some details with you shortly.

I'd say that we're going to cover Kabirou's M&A strategy, but he unfortunately doesn't have one. Right now he is in the process of several dozens of negotiations, trying to cash out of Wari (at least a little bit) and cash into some European/US business. We'll cover the most important processes shortly, and then in more detail, if any of these negotiations actually yields some results.

Wari employees will be delighted to read some documents on internal management, HR policies and compensations. Did you realize that the difference between the highest and the lowest full-time salaries in Wari is more than 100 times? Yeah, wait for details.

We'll also uncover some details about Kabirou's family, and why his children are so grateful to him at the moment. Apart from family there is also some private life - but you remember the First Rule - so we'll uncover that too.

Currently the members of the club include about 1600 people - those who were in contact with Kabirou during the last year and instantly fell in love with him. The full list of members is available in this Excel file. Some of the Club members are special, and we'll devote separate pieces to them and their affairs.
Unfortunately, some very important members are missing from this list, and we need them to be with us. If you are in contact with:
- Cheikh Tagué, Seyni Kamara or Malick Fall;
- Ex-partners, business associates or employees unlawfully fired by Kabirou;
- Journalists in African, French or international media, who are interested in writing about the "Young tycoon" and "African Elon Mask";
please, add their emails in the form at the bottom, and we'll welcome new members in our Club.

Basic membership in the club is free of charge. However, if you have any special requests on Kabirou's documents and exchanges, or if you would like to have the whole archive of documents right now - contact me at info@warileaks.com, and we'll work something out. Club membership is irrevocable - you can't just stop being a fan of Kabirou, nobody can.

All materials in this website can be reproduced in any form and with any purposes (remember the First Rule). If you are publishing something based on our materials, please, send me a link (info@warileaks.com), and I'll promote this link in my site.

Stay tuned!

Cordialement, <br/>Founder and President,<br/>Kabirou Mbodje Fan Club.
