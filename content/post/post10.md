While Kabirou is enjoying the Black Sea coast in Romania together with his friends [Isaac Gueye](https://res.cloudinary.com/vincentstradic/image/upload/v1524667135/post10/post10_pic2.jpg) and [Andreea Belba](https://res.cloudinary.com/vincentstradic/image/upload/v1524667135/post10/post10_pic1.jpg) (photos on click), let's reveal some truth about what actually was happening between Wari and Tigo from signing and up to terminating the share purchase agreement.

The best source about this affair is Mr. Barthélemy Faye, who acted as legal advisor to Kabirou from Autumn 2016 till summer 2017. According to him, after a very brief and limited study of Tigo, Wari supplied their proposal in December with an exceptionally high price. By his estimation, the second best offer - from the Consortium - was less than $100 mln.

During the actual negotiations of the purchase, they had to face our good friend, Anja Blumert of Millicom, who, according to Barthélemy, proved to be  extremely difficult to deal with. Even her key legal counsel had trouble keeping her in check. Way to go, Anja!

The biggest issue was the initial deposit Wari had to make. Anja insisted on 20% of the whole price ($26 mln), most likely because she doubted that Wari can get the necessary funds. At the same time, Consortium (represented primarily by Xavier Niel) tried to persuade Kabirou to share control over Tigo. These discussions continued after the agreement was signed: the Consortium tried to push the negotiation on a financial level so as to put Wari on a weaker footing, as they suspected that Wari might have an issue with the financing.

Wari did not to reveal any information on the deal financing to the Consortium. However, the Consortium knew about clause 7.1(c) of the agreement - allowing Tigo to cancel the deal if Wari doesn't show proofs of available finances. This clause was introduced into the agreement as a trade-off for reducing the initial deposit from $26 million to $10 million.

In the meanwhile, Wari was actively searching for money. According to the Kabirou's legal advisor's, the biggest obstacle was that Kabirou did not want to share the financial data of Wari with local banks. Millicom kept asking Wari whether they found the money, and of course Kabirou kept stalling. Soon it became apparent that the local banks would not finance the acquisition, so Kabirou tried different financial agents and advisors, even the most exotic ones. At the same time, Kabirou refused to give guarantees on behalf of Wari (again, most likely because he wanted to avoid financial audit of Wari by someone, who could share details with Senegalese authorities).

An important meeting between Wari and Tigo happened on June 2, 2017. Wari wanted to get rid of the problematic clause in the agreement, because with this clause, the agreement could be rightfully terminated by Millicom at any time. However, Wari had nothing to give or promise to Millicom, to compensate for the delay and uncertainty.

The key meeting was attended by Aicha Kouyate and Barthélemy Faye for Wari, Anja Blumert, Vincent Le Stradic and Jacques Naquet-Radiguet for Millicom. At the meeting, Wari told Millicom that it needed to get rid of clause 7.1(c). Millicom people asked for a break-out session, which lasted for at least an hour, and then told Wari that the clause could not be removed. However, they told Wari:  "We are still very supportive of Wari and want to close with you …  We will not close with someone else …  We are here to help."  Most likely Millicom were sincere about this - Wari had made such a good offer that Millicom really wanted to make it work.

In his testimony Mr. Barthélemy Faye stated specifically, that during this meeting Millicom **DID NOT AGREE** to remove the problematic clause (7.1c) from the contract. Later on, Wari will be lying about this fact on every corner and in every lawsuit.

Soon after the meeting, Wari engaged Afreximbank as a potential funder for the deal. However Mr. Faye believes that Afreximbank could not provide funds on their own and they wanted to get involved as an intermediary agent. They did a two-month's due diligence on Millicom, completely paid for by Wari.

On July 6, the respected member of our Club Anja Blumert wrote a letter to Wari, saying, among other:
_"Given the serious concerns you have now raised concerning your ability to raise the financing required to close this transaction, **Millicom will be reviewing its options and reserves its rights to take all necessary actions**"_.

Then, as you all know, Wari, Afreximbank and Tigo met on July 26, 2017, and, according to Wari's version, Afreximbank said that "they do not see obstacles for financing the deal". I'm no lawyer, but my feeling is that there's a world of difference between "will get you the money" and "don't see obstacles for financing". Anyway, two days later, Millicom announced that they terminate the agreement with Wari and sign a new one with Consortium.

Let's now stop at this point, and I'm sorry to bother you with such a long story. The testimony of Barthélemy Faye finishes with some advice he gave to Kabirou right after this termination happened, and as we all know from the press, Kabirou mostly followed them. Barthélemy suggested:

- Playing up the enormous error that Millicom and the Consortium had made in not meeting with the Senegalese State;

- Firming up the financing, with a proper term-sheet, to convince the State that Wari had access to financing for the deal; and

- Helping the Senegalese State to protect its reputation as a good place to do business.
Barthélemy Faye believed that this would allow the Senegalese State (with support from the French State) to put pressure on Millicom and the Consortium to allow the Wari deal to continue.
