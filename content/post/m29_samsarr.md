Dear Club-members, we need to make a decision.
<!--more-->
<br>
</br>

I have about 100 email exchanges between Kabirou Mbodje and Samuel Sarr. I did not get into detail on these mails, because I didn't realize this was the same Samuel Sarr, ex-Minister.

From what I saw, I know he is a crook in the pocket of Kabirou.

So, let's vote:

- If I should temporarily suspend publications about Wari and concentrate on Samuel Sarr, <a href="mailto:info@warileaks.com?Subject=Voting&body=Pour%20SSarr">press this link</a> to send me a letter.

- If I should ignore Samuel Sarr and continue with Kabirou Mbodje, <a href="mailto:info@warileaks.com?Subject=Voting&body=Pour%20Kabirou">press this link</a> to send me a letter.

- If you don't vote, but want to see the results, <a href="mailto:info@warileaks.com?Subject=Voting&body=montrez%20resultats">press this link</a> to send me a letter

I will wait for 24 hours before counting the votes. Good voting to you and all your friends!
