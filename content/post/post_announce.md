Ok, my friends. I wasn't sure we'll need it, but given the number of requests and issues about Wari's activity, it is becoming inevitable.

During the next week or two, I'm going to deploy and publish the full copy of Wari transactions database, and then we'll start analyzing it together.

I'll provide read-only access to data on 2016 and 2017, this should be enough for us to find the missing money.

Will keep you posted.
