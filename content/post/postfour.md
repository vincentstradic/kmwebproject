Thank you, dear friends and co-members, for your warm support. I could not imagine our hero was so popular in Senegal. Since Friday, I had more than 5000 visitors, and almost 450 new subscriptions to the newsletter.

However, I will only send weekly updates in the email, because I myself hate spam as much as you do (or more). So if you want to keep track with our news and publications, simply come to my website, there will be new posts every working day - and maybe, some on the weekend, too.

I got several letters asking for the full archive of materials. So here's what we'll do: I'm starting an auction for the full archive of Kabirou Mbodje club, containing more than 5000 letters and documents. The starting price is $20 000. Every day I'll publish the current highest bid, and, if during the next 24 hours I don't receive a better offer, I'll give it to the highest bidder. This bidder will be able to choose, if he wants to have an exclusive access, or I can continue publishing these materials on my own.

Latest news is that Kabirou almost had a heart attack, when it became clear that he lost in the battle for Tigo. He contacted me and demanded that I publish everything I have about Tigo, the deal, the Consortium. He even approved publishing the legal strategy in the International Arbitrage agains Consortium, despite my advise to stay reasonable (yeah, like Kabirou would ever listen to advice). So, per Kabirou's instructions, today I'll start by publishing all the Tigo-side materials of the deal, and then in the next couple of days we'll cover Wari side of the deal, "Wasabi" project and the arbitrage strategy. As far as I see from the site logs, guys from "[Skadden, Arps, Slate, Meagher & Flom LLP](https://www.skadden.com/)" paid a lot of attention to our small project, so, I guess, we can welcome them as devoted members of the club.

It was also a pleasure to see [Anja Blumert](mailto:anja.blumert@millicom.com ) at our site. Mrs. Blumert, you are always very welcome, but the next couple of days you can miss, there will be nothing new for you there.

Thanks again for being with us, let's move forward!
