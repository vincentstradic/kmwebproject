We all know that Kabirou is rich. But how rich? Let's see.

We'll start with a very simple document, his Declaration Patrimoine [(pdf version)](https://res.cloudinary.com/vincentstradic/image/upload/v1523977187/DECLARATION_PATRIMOINE_rawizo.pdf), which is supposed to  cover all of his assets. As we'll learn later, it's neither complete, nor correct.

Kabirou's response to "How rich are you?" very much depends on who is asking, and the answer may be sometimes very surprising. Later on we'll get to some property and income statements he made to different banks, but there are so many versions, that we'll probably never learn the whole truth.

During the next few days, we're going to study the ownership structure of Wari, the company revenues, balance and share value, and together we'll try to understand why Kabirou is so willing to sell Wari shares right now.

**Stay tuned!**
