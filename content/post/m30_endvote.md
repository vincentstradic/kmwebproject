Dear friends, I'll stop the voting. I see that Samuel Sarr is much more popular than Kabirou Mbodje: 173 votes against 51.

<!--more-->

However, I also received an offer to sell information about Sarr, and, pardon me my dear readers, but I need to eat, too.

So, we'll continue with our main hero, Mr. Kabirou Mbodje!



Stay tuned!
