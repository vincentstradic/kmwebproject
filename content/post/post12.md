Dear Kabirou,

While the nation is enjoying the Labor day, and you are attending some stupid music festival in Romania, I wanted to remember your last vacation, in Tulum. There are a few things I don't know or understand, so I hoped you could clarify them for me...
<!--more-->

I understand you flew in and out of Tulum with your friend, Isaac Gueye. You paid $48 000 for the hotel, then â‚¬4 600 for one villa and $25 000 for another villa. Then you paid $15 000 for a table at one music festival and another $15 000 for another music event - you must really love music! Or it's Isaac who loves music, and you just happen to like Isaac. Never mind.

My question: in the exchanges I see that about hotels and villas, you were accompanied by **"Maria + 3 daughters"**. Here I am confused, because it was my impression that you only had two daughters, and neither of their mothers' name is Maria. Maybe, some other daughter? Isn't it nice, when you go to an exotic country and suddenly meet there a woman with three daughters?

Then there was a "Kimi", who was not part of the original plan, but then joined at your invitation in these music events. Is she a fourth daughter? Or a young auntie? Is this her in the picture?
