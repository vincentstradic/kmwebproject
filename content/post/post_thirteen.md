Hi, everyone! I made a promise and now I need to keep it. So here you go:

**Dear Mr. <a href="mailto:bernard@marchal.eu?subject=Consultez cet article sur warileaks.com, SVP&body=http://warileaks.com/fr">Bernard Marchal</a> of BCM PARTICIPATIONS and Mr. <a href="mailto:frederic.queru@ardian.com?subject=Consultez cet article sur warileaks.com, SVP&body=http://warileaks.com/fr">Frédéric QUÉRU</a> of ARDIAN,**

On behalf of the Kabirou Mbodje Fan Club, I would be grateful if you could answer a simple question for us. Below you'll see three documents, all three signed by you and Kabirou Mbodje. But while your signatures look identical, Kabirou's are somehow different:

</div>

  </a>
</div>
<br></br>
So the big question is: which of them is authentic?
Of course I know the answer, because I've seen the original document - [attached](https://res.cloudinary.com/vincentstradic/image/upload/v1524671186/psto13/WARI-TSI_AVENANT-Signe%CC%81.pdf).

But you know who does NOT have the right answer? <a href="mailto:wing.yan.chau@hsbc.com.hk?subject=Check this post at warileaks.com, please&body=http://warileaks.com">KARIE W Y CHAU</a> and <a href="mailto:chris.c.k.tam@hsbc.com.hk?subject=Check this post at warileaks.com, please&body=http://warileaks.com">Chris C K TAM</a> from the Hong Kong HSBC bank.

Dear Karie and Chris, could you clarify for us, which of those copies you finally received? Just curious. You see, it doesn't actually matter, because when Kabirou was sending these documents to you, the contract in question was not even valid, Mr. Marchal and Mr. Queru can attest to that.

Kabirou decided that he is going to purchase TSI Payments through his SMARTWORLDS company, and, as we saw recently, he accumulated significant sums there.
<div class="container" style="width:auto">
  <a target="blank" href="https://image.ibb.co/dGo8Ld/km2tam.jpg">
    <img src="https://image.ibb.co/dGo8Ld/km2tam.jpg" style="padding:1px;border:thin solid green;max-width:100%">
  </a>
</div>
<br></br>
He informed HSBC about this transaction and they asked to produce a copy of the contract. But since the original contract was with Wari Luxembourg, Kabirou had to forge SMARTWORLDS company name into the signatures list.

Now, of course, there's a great question - where does the money come from? And I happen to have an answer for you:

<div class="container" style="width:auto">
  <a target="blank" href="https://image.ibb.co/kwGv0d/km2hsbc.jpg">
    <img src="https://image.ibb.co/kwGv0d/km2hsbc.jpg" style="padding:1px;border:thin solid green;max-width:100%">
  </a>
</div>
