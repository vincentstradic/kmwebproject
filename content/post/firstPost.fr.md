I'll start by establishing some credibility, so that no one has any doubts about the materials presented in this site. Please, see the current French passport of Kabirou Mbodje:
<div class="container" style="width:auto">

    <img src="https://res.cloudinary.com/vincentstradic/image/upload/v1523977187/Kabirou_passport_ca14jy.jpg" style="max-width:100%">
  </a>
</div>

As well as his old passport:

    <img src="https://res.cloudinary.com/vincentstradic/image/upload/v1523977188/Kabirou_old_passport_wct6ij.jpg" style="max-width:100%">
  </a>
</div>

In this project I'll stick to two important rules:
- Everything I write, will be supported by documents or letters and all the proofs will be published.
- All the documents are received directly from Kabirou (_"Man of No Secrets"_), proofs of authenticity are always available upon request.

**Stay tuned!**
