Today we give special welcome to **Lâ€™Office National de lutte contre la Fraude et Corruption**, who joined our club recently. Gentlemen, you are very welcome and if you ever need anything - just let me know, I guarantee full transparency at all times!

Also, because of the recently obtained materials, these archives are not for sale any more. Sorry.

Please, be assured that I'm reading all the emails to info@warileaks.com, even if I am not answering immediately. Your bids are noted, your emails are added to the newsletter, so don't worry. I also received a handful of new materials about Kabirou, thanks a lot to everyone who sent them me, I'll add them to future publications, without mentioning where I got them, of course.

Today I'll just add a few more strokes about Wari-Vodafone cooperation. Two documents for you, both coming from Vodafone.

Please, meet [Laxman Karnam](mailto:laxman.karnam@vodafone.com), Director Strategic Partnerships-Africa in [Vodafone](https://www.vodafone.com/). He visited Senegal in March this year and, according to himself, did a lot of lobbying for Wari. In three days he met with:

- HMA George Hodgson, British Ambassador to Senegal

- Modou Mamoune Ngom, Director of Telecommunications, Ministry of Posts & Telecoms

- Mansour Gaye, Managing Partner - Grant Thornton, Senegal

- Ibrahima Chiekh Dong & Fabrice Nze Bekale, CEO & Managing Partner - ACT Africa

- Julia Loayza & Arthur Denise Pascal, Designation: Senior Country Economist & ICT Team leader (remote via VC) - World Bank

- Faheen Allibhoy, Country Manager for Senegal - International Finance Corporation.

Mr. Karnam wrote a detailed report on these meetings and shared it with Kabirou (being good friends and all). [The report](https://res.cloudinary.com/vincentstradic/image/upload/v1524484343/postseven/Senegal_Visit_-_notes_March_2018_ver_1.0.pdf) is in English only.

Just a small fun fact for you: Mr. Laxman Karman mentioned in his report that the meeting with Faheen Allibhoy was organized by Kabirou on a very short notice. Well, this was easy for Kabirou - for the past 11 years Mme Allibhoy has worked together with **Margrit Nzuki**, Investment Officer in the Senegalese branch of International Finance Corporation and the mother of Kabirou's fourth kid. They are not formally married though - I guess, Kabirou is saving himself for another... ;)

The second piece also comes from Vodafone, and it's a perfect demonstration of Kabirou's attitude to his partners. I guess, no explanation is needed on this one:

 The usual tactics of Kabirou: use people, then fuck them (pardon my Swahili). We'll see a lot of such examples in the future. I guess, this is exactly why we are all here, members of Kabirou Mbodje Fan-Club!</p>

Stay tuned!
