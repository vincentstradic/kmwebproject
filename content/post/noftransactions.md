In his latest interview about Wari, [Kabirou keeps insisting on "one million transactions per day"](http://jubanti.com/actualite/pourquoi-wari-gene-comment-tigo-la-echappe-les-manoeuvres-de-xavier-niel-kabirou-mbodje-dit-tout-interview/). Well, not exactly.

This is one slide from the internal 2017 performance review. As you see, not even close to a million per day. In September 2017 there were less than 7 million transactions during the whole month. And the maximum was in August with 9.7 million per month. **About three times less than according to Kabirou.**

You may assume that there was a great increase in 2018? Sorry, but you are totally wrong. As a matter of fact, **the first four months in 2018 showed an 11% decrease (!!!) as compared to 2017.** I'll have documents on that for you shortly.

Naturally, the revenue showed stagnation during the whole 2017, followed by the same drop in 2018:
