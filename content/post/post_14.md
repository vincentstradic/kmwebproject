Hi, everyone, today another piece on the Wari-Tigo story.

You well remember the Afreximbank, that "did not see any obstacles" to finance the Tigo deal, but did not show any money either. That was in August 2017.

And then, out of nowhere, a strange story happened in March 2018. It begins with the letter from Dr. Benedict Okey Oramah, President of African Exportâ€“Import Bank (Afreximbank) to his employees:
<div class="container" style="width:auto">
  <a target="blank" href="https://image.ibb.co/cdXfkd/14_1.jpg">
    <img src="https://image.ibb.co/cdXfkd/14_1.jpg" style="max-width:100%">
  </a>
</div>
<br></br>
And then Rene Awambeng, Global Head Client Relations of the same bank, responded with:
<div class="container" style="width:auto">
  <a target="blank" href="https://image.ibb.co/nnFpdy/14_2.jpg">
    <img src="https://image.ibb.co/nnFpdy/14_2.jpg" style="max-width:100%">
  </a>
</div>
<br></br>
**What?!! Seriously?!!**

And then Mr. Alain-Thierry Mbongue contacts Aicha to clarify:
<div class="container" style="width:auto">
  <a target="blank" href="https://image.ibb.co/j1RjBJ/14_3.jpg">
    <img src="https://image.ibb.co/j1RjBJ/14_3.jpg" style="max-width:100%">
  </a>
</div>
<br></br>
Naturally, Aicha has no idea about what's going on. Neither has Samuel Sarr, who writes:
<div class="container" style="width:auto">
  <a target="blank" href="https://image.ibb.co/caRUdy/14_4.jpg">
    <img src="https://image.ibb.co/caRUdy/14_4.jpg" style="max-width:100%">
  </a>
</div>
<br></br>
Then Amadou Diop vaguely confirms that there was some discussion:
<div class="container" style="width:auto">
  <a target="blank" href="https://image.ibb.co/fqt9dy/14_5.jpg">
    <img src="https://image.ibb.co/fqt9dy/14_5.jpg" style="max-width:100%">
  </a>
</div>
<br></br>
Aicha is still very confused, but she feels she needs to do something. So here she goes:
<div class="container" style="width:auto">
  <a target="blank" href="https://image.ibb.co/iSYLkd/14_6.jpg">
    <img src="https://image.ibb.co/iSYLkd/14_6.jpg" style="max-width:100%">
  </a>
</div>
<br></br>
And that's the end of the story. As far as I know there has been no further communication on the issue.

Was there really some agreement on 50-50, confirmed by the President of the Republic? Could be. Could be that the recent events are actually just a screen for some undercover agreements...

Stay tuned, we'll get to it.
