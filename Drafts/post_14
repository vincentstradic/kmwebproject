Hi, everyone, another small piece of the Wari-Tigo story.

As you already know, until quite recently Kabirou was still searching for money to buy Tigo. He tried with Korea Telecom, but they too, did not like zero transparency on Wari's finances. Then he tried those "secret oil money", and happily got out of this affair without losing 1 million USD. As it happens, only frauds are ready to finance a shady and non-transparent enterprise, which losing to their competition every day...

Then in March something strange happened. Dr. Benedict Okey Oramah, President of African Exportâ€“Import Bank (Afreximbank) writes to his employees:



"I met with Mr. Kabirou , CEO of WARI  in Kigali 2 days ago . He mentioned to me that they had reached a settlement regarding the Tigo acquisition. President Marky Sal confirmed same to me.
Wari is now proposing to re- approach the Bank for support on the terms of the settlement. Please contact them to discuss further."

And then, Rene Awambeng, Global Head Client Relations of the same bank, writes further:
"I did engage Karibou and he confirmed that they would do a 50/50 deal with FREE on the Tigo acquisition."

**What?!? Seriously???** I guess, there are a lot of things we still don't know, my friends.
