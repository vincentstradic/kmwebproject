Post four April 23

**Welcome to the club**

Thank you, dear friends and co-members, for your warm support. I could not imagine our hero was so popular in Senegal. Since Friday, I had more than 5000 visitors, and almost 450 new subscriptions to the newsletter.

However, I will only send weekly updates in the email, because I myself hate spam as much as you do (or more). So if you want to keep track with our news and publications, simply come to my website, there will be new posts every working day - and maybe, some on the weekend, too.

I got several letters asking for the full archive of materials. So here's what we'll do: I'm starting an auction for the full archive of Person_name club, containing more than 5000 letters and documents. The starting price is $20 000. Every day I'll publish the current highest bid, and, if during the next 24 hours I don't receive a better offer, I'll give it to the highest bidder. This bidder will be able to choose, if he wants to have an exclusive access, or I can continue publishing these materials on my own.

Latest news is that Kabirou almost had a heart attack, when it became clear that he lost in the battle for Tigo. He contacted me and demanded that I publish everything I have about Tigo, the deal, the Consortium. He even approved publishing the legal strategy in the International Arbitrage  agains Consortium, despite my advise to stay reasonable (yeah, like Kabirou would ever listen to advice). So, per Kabirou's instructions, today I'll start by publishing all the Tigo-side materials of the deal, and then in the next couple of days we'll cover Wari's side of the deal, "Wasabi" project and the arbitrage strategy. As far as I see from the site logs, guys from "[Skadden, Arps, Slate, Meagher & Flom LLP](https://www.skadden.com/)" paid a lot of attention to our small project, so, I guess, we can welcome them as devoted members of the club.

It was also a pleasure to see [Anja Blumert](mailto:anja.blumert@millicom.com ) at our site. Mrs. Blumert, you are always very welcome, but the next couple of days you can miss, there will be nothing new for you there.

Thanks again for being with us, let's move forward (avançons?)!

 **Tigo for sale**

Well, actually, I was wrong, we need Mrs. Blumert here, because we may have a question to her concerning these materials. Here is picture  from your presentation from September 20, 2016:
{picture}

Is this scheme legal? It looks like tax evasion to me, but I am no expert, of course. I see that in 2016 more than 6 milliards CFA were paid to the Standard bank in Mauritius as interest on the loan, while Tigo showed losses and and thus avoided paying profit taxes in Senegal.

I'll publish a few more interesting pictures for the presentation, and then attach links to all downloadable documents.

Wasabi

Hi, everyone, let's start with some updates. First, during the last 24 hours I received two bids for the full archive of the club, the highest price currently standing at $30 000 USD. Way to go, guys!

I also found some disturbing photos in the archive. I guess, you can call them erotic, if you are into this kind of "erotic"... I'll need to check with Kabirou first, if it will be OK that I publish them here. Will let you know, what he decides.

Today we'll review what Kabirou wanted to do with Tigo, when he thought he was gonna get it. First of all - the plan was to keep the same tax evasion scheme after the sale. Believe it or not, they were planning to buy Tigo Senegal for just $1. See the presentation attached.



Another interesting fact I found in the Business Plan of Wari, here it is:

Remember those words I underlined in red, we'll need them later, when we'll be comparing Wari business plan with Wari reality...

And now I'm introducing "Project Wasabi":

As you see, the key point of the plan is to give full control over Tigo to Vodafone, which is quite logical, because, of course, Wari doesn't have a clue about how to manage a cellular operator.

The project is supported by detailed business plans, which look really cool on paper, but unfortunately have nothing to do with reality (as most of the things Wari is providing to public). Let me explain this to you in simple terms:
- 98% of Wari revenue comes from transactions. More transactions, more revenue, less transactions - you got it...
- According to the business plan, there were 97 mln transactions in 2016. Let's assume it's true.
- The same business plan says, that in 2017 there will be 133 millions of transactions. This business plan was finalized on September 21, 2017, which means, Wari already had the statistics for 2/3 of the year.
- Now imagine this: during the first 8 months of 2017 (by September 1) Wari registered 61 million transactions in 2017. So we have to believe, that somehow in the remaining 4 months Wari will make another 72 million transactions. Really? Well, no.
- And now the forecast for 2018 is ... 187 millions of transactions. Later on, we'll dig into Wari's 2018 statistics and see, what's actually happening. I am waiting for the end of April, to give you the full picture for the first 4 months. But, it's kind of not even close. That's why, more recent business plans developed by Wari.

Below you'll see the rest of the documents about Wari-Tigo-Vodafone. Those were really sweet dreams, n'est-ce pas, Kabirou?


Post seven, April 25

Today we give special welcome to the OFFICE_NAME, who joined our club recently. Gentlemen, you are very welcome and if you ever need anything - just let me know, I guarantee full transparency at all times!

During the last day I received 5 new bids, the highest now stands at $51 000. And it looks like some of the players are just getting their appetite, so let's see, where it leads us. By the way, if you are interested in some specific subject, ask me, maybe I can help you with a smaller deal.

By the way, please, be assured that I'm reading and taking note of all the emails to info@warileaks.com. Your bids for the materials are taken into consideration, and I'm adding the mailing list everyone who asks me. I also received a handful of new materials about Kabirou, thanks a lot to everyone who sent me, I'll add them to future publications as well, but I will never mention, where I got them from.

Today I'll add a few more strokes about Wari-Vodafone cooperation. Just two documents for you, both coming from Vodafone.

1. Please, meet [Laxman Karnam](mailto:laxman.karnam@vodafone.com), "Director Strategic Partnerships - Africa" in Vodafone. He visited Senegal in March this year and, according to himself, did a lot of lobbying for Wari. In three days he met with:
- HMA George Hodgson, British Ambassador to Senegal
- Modou Mamoune Ngom, Director of Telecommunications, Ministry of Posts & Telecoms
- Mansour Gaye, Managing Partner - Grant Thornton, Senegal
- Ibrahima Chiekh Dong & Fabrice Nze Bekale, CEO & Managing Partner - ACT Africa
- Julia Loayza & Arthur Denise Pascal, Designation: Senior Country Economist & ICT Team leader (remote via VC) - World Bank
- Faheen Allibhoy, Country Manager - IFC

Then he wrote a detailed report on these meetings and shared it with Kabirou (being good friends and all). The report in English is attached, as usual.

Just a small fun fact for you: Mr. Laxman Karman mentioned in his report that the meeting with Faheen Allibhoy was organied by Kabirou on a very short notice. Well, this was easy for Kabirou - for the past 11 years Mme Allibhoy has been managing the mother of Kabirou's fourth kid, Margrit Nzuki, who works as Investment Officer in the Senegalese branch of International Finance Corporation. They are not formally married however, I guess, Kabirou is saving himself for someone else... ;)

2. The second piece also comes from Vodafone, and it's a perfect demonstration of Kabirou's attitude to his partners. Here it goes:

I guess, no explanation is needed on this one. It's the usual policy of Kabirou - use people, then fuck them (pardon my Suahili). We'll see a lot of examples of that shortly.

Stay tuned!

Post eight, April 26

Ok, I got just one new bid, and it's for $101 000. The email is anonymous (that's why I'm not answering it directly for now), but it looks like some serious player is in town, finally. Let's wait for tomorrow.

Today I have a very nice story for you, my friends. I'll tell you what I know, and I'll show you letters and documents, but something tells me there are a lot of lies in this story. Let's see:

Kabirou has a partner, M. Samuel A. Sarr, Ancien Ministre d'Etat and CEO of AFRINVEST SA. Samuel was helping Kabirou to find financing for the Tigo deal (another fun fact - Kabirou claims that he had all the money by August 2017, but in January 2018 he was still looking for this money).

This Samuel found some Sajid Barkat, "Managing partner of WORLD Group Holding Ltd". According to [Dubai company registry](https://www.difc.ae/public-register/world-group-holding-limited) it's a small company, registered in May 2017 with a capital of $50 000. Their office is "Unit  OFFICE 03 C , Level 1, Gate Village Building 3, Dubai" - doesn't sound impressive, right?
There's also another guy in this story, some Aidivandi Koosha, of [KOOSHA HOLDING](https://kooshaholding.com).

Anyway, this Sajid found 130 million dollars to finance Wari deal. The source of this money was described this way: "des fonds provenant de revenus pétroliers d'un autre pays". But they were going to come "from COMMERZBANK Berlin from the private account of Koosha Holdings". And there was a letter attached from Commerzbank, check it out:

{picture}

The letter from Samuel read:
"Très confidentiel à ne remettre à personne (uniquement au PR ou MEF pour lecture jusqu'à signature et remise des fonds, car comme vous le savez ce sont des fonds provenant de revenus pétroliers d'un autre pays."

I think I know who are those "PR" and "MEF". But let's take a closer look at this document:

{picture}

Do those signature look legitimate to you? I don't think so. Looks like they are coming from different documents. Also, I spent a lot of time searching those "Dr. Rainer Haas" and "Dr.h.c Werner Schröder" in COMMERZBANK, and I don't think these people exist at all. All of that resembles an fraud by  Sajid Barkat. Why? Because his next request was:

"We had moved forward and done our part in good faith and considering long term relationship with yourself. As agreed earlier our fee will be 20% of the investment amount. At this stage to move forward we request you to provide our consultancy and commitment fee which will be 3% of total investment value so we can provide the original bank letter and investment contract for signature. After signature and successful transfer of funds to your account we require remaining 17% of total investment amount
We look forward to receiving the payment confirmation of 3% value amount. After that we can meet in Istanbul for final signatures."

By the way, in the process of those negotiations with "Koosha" and "oil-making country", Mr. Sajid Barkat got a very interesting document from Kabirou, I think some members of the club will truly enjoy it:

{picture}

Stay tuned!

Post nine, April 27

No new bids today, I'm starting to negotiate the conditions with the highest bidder. Will keep you posted.

In the meanwhile I have another nice story for you, also about the Tigo deal. The story is told in three small acts:

Act 1.
A document:
{post_nine_pic_1}

I should mention that this whole document is a lie, because the account 801-411596-838 does not belong to Wari (Togo). Also, contrary to what the ex-Wari shareholders say, it doesn't belong to Wari Limited.

In fact, this account belongs to SMARTWORLDS Ltd., the private pocket of Kabirou (see [one of my previous posts](http://warileaks.com/the-structure-of-wari-group/)).

But let's move with the story.

Act 2.
A letter:
{post_nine_pic_2}

Act 3.
Et voilà:
{post_nine_pic_3 and post_nine_pic_4}

Finita la comedia.

Now, remember this guy, [Maitre Tete WILSON-BAHUN](mailto:tetewils3@gmail.com), a very helpful notary, ready to sign whatever they ask him to sign. Together with Pape Magatte Diop he was involved in a huge corruption scheme. It's amazing, how shameless these guys are. I'm writing a story on that, you'll read it soon.

Stay tuned!

----------------------------------------------------------------------

POST TEN, April 30

While Kabirou is enjoying the Black Sea coast in Romania together with his friends Isaac Gueye and Andreea Belba (photos on click), we continue our research into the business and private affairs of our hero.

First, about the auction. Unfortunately, the guy I thought was a serious player, kind of disappeared, so - not so serious, after all. Therefore, the bidding continues. The second highest bid was $60 000, we start from there and I'm freezing the auction for one week. You're welcome to send your bids and proposals during the whole week.

And now let's dive into the Wari-Tigo deal/conflict. The more I learn about it, the more I become convinced that at least since last summer, Kabirou didn't really want to buy Tigo. It is event quite possible that the latest presidential decree was orchestrated by Kabirou: he still (!) doesn't have money to buy Tigo, and he is counting on a huge compensation from Tigo and Consortium.

I won't try to tell the whole Wari-Tigo story, it's long and boring for the most part. Let's just try to review some highlights using firm documents and testimonies of the people involved.

The best source about the beginning of the affair is Mr. Barthélemy Faye, who acted as legal advisor to Kabirou from Autumn 2016 till summer 2017. According to him, after a very brief and limited study of Tigo, Wari supplied their proposal in December with an exceptionally high price. By his estimation, the second best offer - from the Consortium - did not go higher than $100 mln.

During the actual negotiations of the purchase, they had to face our good friend, Anja Blumert of Millicom, who, according to Barthélemy, proved to be  extremely difficult to deal with. Even her key legal counsel had trouble keeping her in check. Way to go, Anja!

The biggest issue during the negotiations was the initial deposit Wari had to make on the signature. Anja insisted on 20% of the whole price ($26 mln),
presumably because she doubted that Wari can get the necessary funds. At the same time, Consortium (represented by no less than Xavier Niel himself) tried to persuade Kabirou to share control over Tigo. These discussions continued even after the agreement was signed: The Consortium tried to push the negotiation on a financial level so as to put Wari on a weaker footing, as the Consortium suspected Wari might have an issue with the financing.

Wari was careful during these discussions not to reveal any information on the deal financing to the Consortium. They refused to provide a copy of the sales agreement to the Consortium, but disclosed the existence of clause 7.1(c) - allowing Tigo to cancel the deal if Wari doesn't show proofs of available finances. This clause was introduced into the agreement as a trade-off for reducing the signing deposit from $26 million to $10 million.

In the meanwhile, Wari was searching for money. According to the Kabirou's legal advisor's, the biggest obstacle was that Kabirou did not want to share Wari financial data with local banks (**I'll explain you this in one of the later posts**). By that time Wari already had a "comfort letter" from UBA, which looked nice but didn't mean any money behind it.

During the four months after the signing, Millicom kept asking whether Wari found the money, and Wari kept stalling. Fairly quickly, it became apparent that the local banks would not finance the acquisition, so Kabirou tried different financial advisors, even the most exotic ones. At the same time, Kabirou refused to give guarantees on behalf of Wari (again, most likely because he wanted to avoid financial audit of Wari by someone, who could share details with Senegalese authorities).

An important meeting between Wari and Tigo happened on June 2, 2017. Wari wanted this meeting to get rid of the problematic clause in the agreement, because, without the funds, it already could be terminated by Millicom at any time. However to achieve that, Wari had to give some reassurance to Millicom, which Wari couldn't. On the contrary, Wari had resisted all Millicom's requests for updates on the situation.

The 2 June 2017 meeting was attended by Aicha Kouyate and Barthélemy Faye for Wari, Anja Blumert, Vincent Le Stradic and Jacques Naquet-Radiguet for Millicom. At the meeting, Wari told Millicom that it needed to get rid of clause 7.1(c). Millicom people asked for a break-out session, which lasted for at least an hour, and then told Wari that the clause could not be removed.  However, they told Wari:  "We are still very supportive of Wari and want to close with you …  We will not close with someone else …  We are here to help."  Most likely Millicom were sincere about this - Wari had made such a good offer that Millicom really wanted to make it work.

In his testimony Mr. Barthélemy Faye stated specifically, that during this meeting Millicom **DID NOT agree** to remove the problematic clause (7.1c) from the contract. Later on, Wari will be lying about this fact on every corner and in every lawsuit.

Soon after the meeting, Wari engaged Afreximbank as a potential funder for the deal. However Mr. Faye believes that Afreximbank could not provide funds on their own and wanted to get involved as an intermediary/agent only. They did a two-month's due diligence on Millicom, completely paid for by Wari.

In the meanwhile, on July 6 our respected member of the Club Anja Blumert wrote a letter to Wari, saying, among other:
_"Given the serious concerns you have now raised concerning your ability to raise the financing required to close this transaction, **Millicom will be reviewing its options and reserves its rights to take all necessary actions**"_.

Then, as you all know, Wari, Afreximbank and Tigo met on July 26, 2017, and, according to Wari's version, Afreximbank said that "they do not see obstacles for financing the deal". I'm no lawyer, but my feeling is that there's a world of difference between "will get you the money" and "don't see obstacles for financing". Anyway, two days later, Millicom announced that they terminate the agreement with Wari and sign a new one with Consortium.

Let's now stop at this point, and I'm sorry to bother you with such a long story. The testimony of Barthélemy Faye finishes with some advice he gave to Kabirou right after this termination happened, and as we all know from the press, Kabirou mostly followed them. Barthélemy suggested:

- Playing up the enormous error that Millicom and the Consortium had made in not meeting with the Senegalese State;
- Firming up the financing, with a proper term-sheet, to convince the State that Wari had access to financing for the deal; and
- Helping the Senegalese State to protect its reputation as a good place to do business.
Barthélemy Faye believed that this would allow the Senegalese State (with support from the French State) to put pressure on Millicom and the Consortium to allow the Wari deal to continue.

To be continued...

POST TWELVE, May 1

Dear Kabirou,

While the nation is enjoying the Labor day, and you are paying for some stupid music festival in Romania, I wanted to remember your last vacation, in Tulum. There are a few things I don't know or understand, so I hoped you could clarify them for me.

I understand you flew in and out of Tulum with your closest friend, Isaac Gueye. You paid $48 000 for the hotel, then 4600 Euro for one villa and 25000 for another villa. Then you paid $15 000 for a table at one music festival and another $15 000 for another music event - you must really love music... Though probably it's Isaac who loves music, and you just happen to like Isaac. Never mind.

My question: in the exchanges I see that in the hotels and villas, you were accompanied by "Maria + 3 daughters". Here I am confused, because it was my impression that you only had two daughters, and neither of their mothers is Maria. Maybe, some other daughter? Isn't it nice, when you go to an exotic country and suddenly meet there a woman with three daughters?

Then there was a "Kimi", who was not part of the original plan, but then joined at your invitation in these music events. Is she a fourth daughter? Or a young auntie?

The whole Club would love to hear from you!

Regards,
Fondateur et President,
Kabirou Mbodje Fan Club.

POST THIRTEEN, May 2

Sorry, guys, I remember I promised you to continue the Wari-Tigo story, but there is another promise I made last week, and I need to keep it. Here you go:

**Dear Mr. Bernard Marchal and Mr. Frederic Queru,**

<!--more-->

On behalf of the Kabirou Mbodje Fan Club, I would be grateful if you could answer a simple question for us. Below you'll see three documents, all three signed by you and Kabirou Mbodje. But while your signatures look identical, Kabirou's are somehow different:

{picture 1}
{picture 2}
{picture 3}

Of course I know the answer, because I've seen the original document - [attached]().

But you know who does not have the right answer? [Karie W Y CHAU](mailto:wing.yan.chau@hsbc.com.hk) and [Chris C K Tam](mailto:chris.c.k.tam@hsbc.com.hk) from the Hong Kong HSBC bank.

You see, Kabirou decided that he is going to purchase TSI through his SMARTWORLDS company, and, as we saw recently, he accumulated significant sums there. He informed HSBC about this transaction and they asked to produce a copy of the contract. But since the original contract was with Wari Luxembourg, Kabirou had to forge SMARTWORLDS company name into the signatures list.

Dear Karie and Chris, could you clarify for us, which of those copies you finally received? Just curious. You see, it doesn't actually matter, because when Kabirou was sending these documents to you, the contract in question was not even valid, Mr. Marchal and Mr. Queru can attest to that.

<hr>

----------------------------------------------------------------------

POST FOURTEEN, May 2

Hi, everyone, now let's continue with the Wari-Tigo story.

As you already know, until quite recently Kabirou was still searching for money to buy Tigo. He tried with Korea Telecom, but they too, did not like zero transparency on Wari's finances. Then he tried those "secret oil money", and happily got out of this affair without loosing 1 mln USD. Only frauds are ready to finance a shady and non-transparent enterprise, who is losing to their competition every day, more and more.

Then in March something strange happened. Dr. Benedict Okey Oramah, President of African Export–Import Bank (Afreximbank) writes to his employees:

"I met with Mr. Kabirou , CEO of WARI  in Kigali 2 days ago . He mentioned to me that they had reached a settlement regarding the Tigo acquisition. President Marky Sal confirmed same to me.
Wari is now proposing to re- approach the Bank for support on the terms of the settlement. Please contact them to discuss further."

And then, Rene Awambeng, Global Head Client Relations of the same bank, writes further:
"I did engage Karibou and he confirmed that they would do a 50/50 deal with FREE on the Tigo acquisition."

What?!? Now, let's see, what Kabirou was doing against Consortium in the meanwhile.
The plan is very simple and very Kabirou-like: if you don't have good arguments, intimidate your adversary and hope that he'll be scared enough. In this case, the objects of intimidation were the [Lazard investment bank](https://www.lazard.com/) and [Xavier Niel](https://www.forbes.com/profile/xavier-niel/) himself. Here's is what Kabirou's main legal counsel thought about it:

"Enfin, nous nous proposons de vous envoyer une note sur les mesures d’expertises dites in futurum (Article 145 du Code de procédure civil français). Il s’agit d’une procédure par laquelle un huissier de justice pourrait être mandaté par un juge pour aller saisir et placer sous scellé des documents concernant notre affaire chez NJJ et Lazard. Cette procédure présente des risques et il n’est pas certain que nous puissions un jour avoir accès aux documents qui auraient été mis sous scellé. Néanmoins, cette mesure pourrait avoir le mérite de faire peser une pression supplémentaire sur le Consortium pendant vos négociations avec le Gouvernement, Millicom et le Consortium."

Kabirou was going to persuade le Président du Tribunal de Commerce de PARIS that Xavier Niel and Vincent Le Stradic conspired against him, to take the Tigo from him. By now you understand already, that Kabirou simply tried to bite more than he could chew. But that's not the spirit of Kabirou )))

So we have ourselves [this document]() - a draft of request to the President of the Commercial Tribunal of Paris.
It begins decisively:
"Par la présente requête, la société Wari S.A. (ci-après Wari) sollicite de Monsieur le Président la désignation d'un huissier de justice et d'un expert informatique aux fins de recueillir les éléments susceptibles d'établir la preuve des faits de concurrence déloyale dont elle est l'objet."

The idea is that the Tribunal should send a bailiff and a technical expert to the office o Vincent Le Stradic and Xavier Niel and search there for any emails or sms, that could prove a conspiracy against Kabirou.

So why am I publishing a draft? Because, as far as I know, this idea was never fully realized. Or, even if it was, I believe, Mr. Vincent Le Stradic was quite prepared.

But why publish this at all then? Because this document, written by a brilliant lawyer from "McDermott Will & Emery" shows with perfect clearness all the weak spots in Wari's position. The comments to this document are more precious, than the document itself. Now let's see some abstracts from the doc:

{picture 1}
{picture 2}
{picture 3}
{picture 4}

The rest you can see in the document. And we'll return to this topic in the future.

POST FIFTEEN, May 3

Today, I'll tell you how Wari lost several hundreds of millions CFA. These slides contain a comprehensive description of a fraud scheme against Wari (French only):

{pictures}

I am attaching also an explication by the fraudster, though there's nothing new there. The funny part here is that Wari was  alerted about the suspicious activity 8 months before they took any action. So they wouldn't loose so much money, if the management actually did their job.

POST SIXTEEN, May 3

Corruption a-la Senegalese

Dear Senegalese branch of the Kabirou Mbodje Fan Club, I am going to show you a blatant examples of Wari top-management corrupting the state authorities of Senegal, and I implore you to take any action necessary to make this public in Senegal.

Remember I told you about a fraud against Wari by some Blaise Kouassi? Naturally, Wari went to the police and asked to have this Blaise arrested. And here is what happened next:

{pictures}

The above is a short exchange between
- Pape Magatte Diop
- Adama Cisse
- Kabirou Mbodje.
Pape Magatte proposes, Adama supports and Kabirou approves giving a bribe of 300 000 CFA, and then another Wari employee, Mame Dior Ndiaye, is expected to carry out the actual bribing.

Usually, cases of corruption are hard to uncover and then even harder to prove, but here everything is crystal clear.

But that is only 300 000 CFA. Soon I'll share with you another example of corruption, involving a bribe of 20 million CFA, done in Togo. We'll need to invite some Togolese media to join our club.

----------------------------------------------------------------------

POST SEVENTEEN, May 3

How Kabirou is fooling two African governments at the same time.

This is the most important post so far. And I need everybody's help to publicize it as much as possible.

I have two documents for you:
The first one is RELEVE DES CONCLUSIONS DE LA RENCONTRE AVEC LE DIRECTEUR NATIONAL DE LA BCEAO POUR LE SENEGAL. These are minutes of the meeting between le Directeur National de la BCEAO pour le Sénégal, Monsieur Ahmadou Al Aminou LO, Monsieur Diaby ABOUBACAR Conseiller du PDG de WARI SA, Monsieur Kabirou MBODJE.

Among other things it states:
"En ce qui concerne le lieu du Siège social, Monsieur Diaby ABOUBACAR a signalé que le Président est d'accord pour le transfert du Siège de Lomé à Dakar, compte tenu des avantages comparatifs de cette dernière ville notamment sur le plan de l'environnement économique, politique et social."

So, on December 28, 2017 Kabirou met with Mr. LO and promised to fully move out of Togo and into Dakar. How patriotic of him.

On the other hand, there's another document. It's a letter from Kabirou to the Division Chief of the tax authorities in Togo, written on March 7, 2018. Surpisingly, it clearly states that Kabirou intends to move all his operations to LOME, and he's giving this as a reason to avoid taxex for 2016 - 2017 (more about that later).

Which of them he's fooling? Both! Because the actual money are still going to his private pocket - SMARTWORLDS.

Stay tuned.
