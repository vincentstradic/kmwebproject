Post four April 23

**Welcome to the club**

Thank you, dear friends and co-members, for your warm support. I could not imagine our hero was so popular in Senegal. Since Friday, I had more than 5000 visitors, and almost 450 new subscriptions to the newsletter.

However, I will only send weekly updates in the email, because I myself hate spam as much as you do (or more). So if you want to keep track with our news and publications, simply come to my website, there will be new posts every working day - and maybe, some on the weekend, too.

I got several letters asking for the full archive of materials. So here's what we'll do: I'm starting an auction for the full archive of Person_name club, containing more than 5000 letters and documents. The starting price is $20 000. Every day I'll publish the current highest bid, and, if during the next 24 hours I don't receive a better offer, I'll give it to the highest bidder. This bidder will be able to choose, if he wants to have an exclusive access, or I can continue publishing these materials on my own.

Latest news is that Kabirou almost had a heart attack, when it became clear that he lost in the battle for Tigo. He contacted me and demanded that I publish everything I have about Tigo, the deal, the Consortium. He even approved publishing the legal strategy in the International Arbitrage  agains Consortium, despite my advise to stay reasonable (yeah, like Kabirou would ever listen to advice). So, per Kabirou's instructions, today I'll start by publishing all the Tigo-side materials of the deal, and then in the next couple of days we'll cover Wari's side of the deal, "Wasabi" project and the arbitrage strategy. As far as I see from the site logs, guys from "[Skadden, Arps, Slate, Meagher & Flom LLP](https://www.skadden.com/)" paid a lot of attention to our small project, so, I guess, we can welcome them as devoted members of the club.

It was also a pleasure to see [Anja Blumert](mailto:anja.blumert@millicom.com ) at our site. Mrs. Blumert, you are always very welcome, but the next couple of days you can miss, there will be nothing new for you there.

Thanks again for being with us, let's move forward (avançons?)!

 **Tigo for sale**

Well, actually, I was wrong, we need Mrs. Blumert here, because we may have a question to her concerning these materials. Here is picture  from your presentation from September 20, 2016:

Is this scheme legal? It looks like tax evasion to me, but I am no expert, of course. I see that in 2016 more than 6 milliards CFA were paid to the Standard bank in Mauritius as interest on the loan, while Tigo showed losses and and thus avoided paying profit taxes in Senegal.

I'll publish a few more interesting pictures for the presentation, and then attach links to all downloadable documents.

Wasabi

Hi, everyone, let's start with some updates. First, during the last 24 hours I received two bids for the full archive of the club, the highest price currently standing at $30 000 USD. Way to go, guys!

I also found some disturbing photos in the archive. I guess, you can call them erotic, if you are into this kind of "erotic"... I'll need to check with Kabirou first, if it will be OK that I publish them here. Will let you know, what he decides.

Today we'll review what Kabirou wanted to do with Tigo, when he thought he was gonna get it. First of all - the plan was to keep the same tax evasion scheme after the sale. Believe it or not, they were planning to buy Tigo Senegal for just $1. See the presentation attached.



Another interesting fact I found in the Business Plan of Wari, here it is:

Remember those words I underlined in red, we'll need them later, when we'll be comparing Wari business plan with Wari reality...

And now I'm introducing "Project Wasabi":

As you see, the key point of the plan is to give full control over Tigo to Vodafone, which is quite logical, because, of course, Wari doesn't have a clue about how to manage a cellular operator.

The project is supported by detailed business plans, which look really cool on paper, but unfortunately have nothing to do with reality (as most of the things Wari is providing to public). Let me explain this to you in simple terms:
- 98% of Wari revenue comes from transactions. More transactions, more revenue, less transactions - you got it...
- According to the business plan, there were 97 mln transactions in 2016. Let's assume it's true.
- The same business plan says, that in 2017 there will be 133 millions of transactions. This business plan was finalized on September 21, 2017, which means, Wari already had the statistics for 2/3 of the year.
- Now imagine this: during the first 8 months of 2017 (by September 1) Wari registered 61 million transactions in 2017. So we have to believe, that somehow in the remaining 4 months Wari will make another 72 million transactions. Really? Well, no.
- And now the forecast for 2018 is ... 187 millions of transactions. Later on, we'll dig into Wari's 2018 statistics and see, what's actually happening. I am waiting for the end of April, to give you the full picture for the first 4 months. But, it's kind of not even close. That's why, more recent business plans developed by Wari.

Below you'll see the rest of the documents about Wari-Tigo-Vodafone. Those were really sweet dreams, n'est-ce pas, Kabirou?


Post seven, April 25

Today we give special welcome to the OFFICE_NAME, who joined our club recently. Gentlemen, you are very welcome and if you ever need anything - just let me know, I guarantee full transparency at all times!

During the last day I received 5 new bids, the highest now stands at $51 000. And it looks like some of the players are just getting their appetite, so let's see, where it leads us. By the way, if you are interested in some specific subject, ask me, maybe I can help you with a smaller deal.

By the way, please, be assured that I'm reading and taking note of all the emails to info@warileaks.com. Your bids for the materials are taken into consideration, and I'm adding the mailing list everyone who asks me. I also received a handful of new materials about Kabirou, thanks a lot to everyone who sent me, I'll add them to future publications as well, but I will never mention, where I got them from.

Today I'll add a few more strokes about Wari-Vodafone cooperation. Just two documents for you, both coming from Vodafone.

1. Please, meet [Laxman Karnam](mailto:laxman.karnam@vodafone.com), "Director Strategic Partnerships - Africa" in Vodafone. He visited Senegal in March this year and, according to himself, did a lot of lobbying for Wari. In three days he met with:
- HMA George Hodgson, British Ambassador to Senegal
- Modou Mamoune Ngom, Director of Telecommunications, Ministry of Posts & Telecoms
- Mansour Gaye, Managing Partner - Grant Thornton, Senegal
- Ibrahima Chiekh Dong & Fabrice Nze Bekale, CEO & Managing Partner - ACT Africa
- Julia Loayza & Arthur Denise Pascal, Designation: Senior Country Economist & ICT Team leader (remote via VC) - World Bank
- Faheen Allibhoy, Country Manager - IFC

Then he wrote a detailed report on these meetings and shared it with Kabirou (being good friends and all). The report in English is attached, as usual.

Just a small fun fact for you: Mr. Laxman Karman mentioned in his report that the meeting with Faheen Allibhoy was organied by Kabirou on a very short notice. Well, this was easy for Kabirou - for the past 11 years Mme Allibhoy has been managing the mother of Kabirou's fourth kid, Margrit Nzuki, who works as Investment Officer in the Senegalese branch of International Finance Corporation. They are not formally married however, I guess, Kabirou is saving himself for someone else... ;)

2. The second piece also comes from Vodafone, and it's a perfect demonstration of Kabirou's attitude to his partners. Here it goes:

I guess, no explanation is needed on this one. It's the usual policy of Kabirou - use people, then fuck them (pardon my Suahili). We'll see a lot of examples of that shortly.

Stay tuned!

Post eight, April 26

Ok, I got just one new bid, and it's for $101 000. The email is anonymous (that's why I'm not answering it directly for now), but it looks like some serious player is in town, finally. Let's wait for tomorrow.

Today I have a very nice story for you, my friends. I'll tell you what I know, and I'll show you letters and documents, but something tells me there are a lot of lies in this story. Let's see:

Kabirou has a partner, M. Samuel A. Sarr, Ancien Ministre d'Etat and CEO of AFRINVEST SA. Samuel was helping Kabirou to find financing for the Tigo deal (another fun fact - Kabirou claims that he had all the money by August 2017, but in January 2018 he was still looking for this money).

This Samuel found some Sajid Barkat, "Managing partner of WORLD Group Holding Ltd". According to [Dubai company registry](https://www.difc.ae/public-register/world-group-holding-limited) it's a small company, registered in May 2017 with a capital of $50 000. Their office is "Unit  OFFICE 03 C , Level 1, Gate Village Building 3, Dubai" - doesn't sound impressive, right?
There's also another guy in this story, some Aidivandi Koosha, of [KOOSHA HOLDING](https://kooshaholding.com).

Anyway, this Sajid found 130 million dollars to finance Wari deal. The source of this money was described this way: "des fonds provenant de revenus pétroliers d'un autre pays". But they were going to come "from COMMERZBANK Berlin from the private account of Koosha Holdings". And there was a letter attached from Commerzbank, check it out:

{picture}

The letter from Samuel read:
"Très confidentiel à ne remettre à personne (uniquement au PR ou MEF pour lecture jusqu'à signature et remise des fonds, car comme vous le savez ce sont des fonds provenant de revenus pétroliers d'un autre pays."

I think I know who are those "PR" and "MEF". But let's take a closer look at this document:

{picture}

Do those signature look legitimate to you? I don't think so. Looks like they are coming from different documents. Also, I spent a lot of time searching those "Dr. Rainer Haas" and "Dr.h.c Werner Schröder" in COMMERZBANK, and I don't think these people exist at all. All of that resembles an fraud by  Sajid Barkat. Why? Because his next request was:

"We had moved forward and done our part in good faith and considering long term relationship with yourself. As agreed earlier our fee will be 20% of the investment amount. At this stage to move forward we request you to provide our consultancy and commitment fee which will be 3% of total investment value so we can provide the original bank letter and investment contract for signature. After signature and successful transfer of funds to your account we require remaining 17% of total investment amount
We look forward to receiving the payment confirmation of 3% value amount. After that we can meet in Istanbul for final signatures."

By the way, in the process of those negotiations with "Koosha" and "oil-making country", Mr. Sajid Barkat got a very interesting document from Kabirou, I think some members of the club will truly enjoy it:

Stay tuned!

Post nine, April 27

No new bids today, I'm starting to negotiate the conditions with the highest bidder. Will keep you posted.

In the meanwhile I have another nice story for you, also about the Tigo deal. The story is told in three small acts:

Act 1.
A document:
{post_nine_pic_1}

I should mention that this whole document is a lie, because the account 801-411596-838 does not belong to Wari (Togo). Also, contrary to what the ex-Wari shareholders say, it doesn't belong to Wari Limited.

In fact, this account belongs to SMARTWORLDS Ltd., the private pocket of Kabirou (see [one of my previous posts](http://warileaks.com/the-structure-of-wari-group/)).

But let's move with the story.

Act 2.
A letter:
{post_nine_pic_2}

Act 3.
Et voilà:
{post_nine_pic_3 and post_nine_pic_4}

Finita la comedia.

Now, remember this guy, [Maitre Tete WILSON-BAHUN](mailto:tetewils3@gmail.com), a very helpful notary, ready to sign whatever they ask him to sign. Together with Pape Magatte Diop he was involved in a huge corruption scheme. It's amazing, how shameless these guys are. I'm writing a story on that, you'll read it soon.

Stay tuned!

POST TEN, April 30

While Kabirou is enjoying the Black Sea coast in Romania together with his friends Isaac Gueye and Andreea Belba (photos of both at click), we continue our research into the business and private affairs of our hero.

First, about the auction. Unfortunately, the guy I thought was a serious player, kind of disappeared, so not so serious, after all. Therefore, the bidding continues. The second highest bid was $60 000, so we'll pick up from here, I will be waiting for your letters.

In view of all the numerous fights of Kabirou against Tigo, let's review, how he is (or was) planning to beat the Consortium in the International Arbitrage.

Short version: he had no good arguments, so he decided to go
