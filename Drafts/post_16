Corruption a-la Senegalese

Dear Senegalese branch of the Kabirou Mbodje Fan Club, I am going to show you a blatant examples of Wari top-management corrupting the state authorities of Senegal, and I implore you to take any action necessary to make this public in Senegal.

Remember I told you about a fraud against Wari by some Blaise Kouassi? Naturally, Wari went to the police and asked to have this Blaise arrested. And here is what happened next:

The above is a short exchange between
- Pape Magatte Diop
- Adama Cisse
- Kabirou Mbodje.
Pape Magatte proposes, Adama supports and Kabirou approves giving a bribe of 300 000 CFA, and another Wari employee, Mame Dior Ndiaye, is expected to carry out the actual bribing.

Usually, cases of corruption are hard to uncover and then even harder to prove, but here everything is crystal clear.

But that is only 300 000 CFA. Soon I'll share with you another example of corruption, involving a bribe of 20 million CFA, done in Togo. We'll need to invite some Togolese media to join our club for that.
