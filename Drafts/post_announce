Ok, my friends. I wasn't sure we'll need it, but given the number of requests and issues about Wari's activity, it is becoming inevitable.

During the next week or two, I'm going to deploy and publish the full copy of Wari transactions database, and then we'll start analyzing different data and statistics, hoping to assess the real scale of embezzlement at Wari.

I have provide data on 2016 and 2017, this will be enough for us to find those missing money. I'll open the read-only access to everyone, hoping that together we'll find concrete proofs of embezzlement.

Will keep you posted.
